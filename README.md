# Workstation setup
Notes to know how I configured my workstation. The base system is `Windows 10` and all instructions use the conventions for this platform. 

Setup customized work environment is hard. I always forget some configuration. This document exists to detail the configuration of my work machine. If I have to change my work station, the configuration I'm going to apply is the one indicated in this document.

> **Note**: All software that I use is free, and can be used in corporate environments for commercial purposes. If any program needs a commercial license it will be indicated.

## Proxy configuration
I set three environment variables to configure the proxy settings only for my user.
* `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`. The format should be: 
`http://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>`
* `NO_PROXY`: Tipically this contains the value: `127.0.0.1,::1,192.168.*` to exclude from the proxy. Note that is a comma-separated list

## Putty
Download `PuTTY` from [here](http://www.putty.org/) and add it to the path. To check if all is ok, open a terminal and type `putty`. If putty opens, then all is configured correctly.

### Create putty sessions
To create new sessions using putty complete the fields `host name or IP`, `port`, select the connection type and set a new name to the session usign the `Saved Sessions` field. When done click on the `Save` button.

## Terminal
I use [`ConEmu`](https://conemu.github.io/) as Windows console, because it allows tabs and more features. I have a custom configuration to create new tasks to open other services. Into the [ConEmu](conemu) directory live my default config file and console background image.

### Open SSH session usign ConEmu
Before open the SSH we need the session configured using putty. When done, open `Settings...` > `Startup` > `Tasks` and select the `+` button. Change the name, apply a hotkey and put into the commands box:
```bat
putty.exe -new_console -load "your_session_name"
```

## Programing languages
List of programing languages that I use in my day to day at work. All can be used from the command line and are present in my `Path`.
* [`Go lang`](https://golang.org/)
* [`Oracle Java 8`](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/es/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [`Kotlin`](https://kotlinlang.org/)

## Developer tools
I use multiple tools, and the configurations for each one are more different. When possible, each tool has an environment variable for the root directory.

### Gradle
Download it from [here](https://gradle.org/install/). I always use the complete flavor, that comes with docs and sources. I added gradle to the `Path` using the `GRADLE_HOME` variable. To configure Gradle to be used with a corporate proxy I need to create the file `<user.home>\.gradle\gradle.properties` and set the proxy settings to it. See [the default gradle properties file](gradle).

* [Configure Gradle to use a proxy](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html)

### Maven
Download the latest version from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Extract and create the environment variable `MAVEN_HOME`. Add to the `Path`. To configure Maven to use the proxy, you need to add a new setting to the `settings.xml` file from the `<user.home>\.m2` directory. If the file not exists then we will need to create it. See the [maven example file](maven)

### Ant
Download the latest version from [here](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi). Create the `ANT_HOME` environment variable and add it to the `Path`
