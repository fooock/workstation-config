# Workstation setup
Notes to know how I configured my workstation. The base system is `Windows 10` and all instructions use the conventions for this platform. 

Setup customized work environment is hard. I always forget some configuration. This document exists to detail the configuration of my work machine. If I have to change my work station, the configuration I'm going to apply is the one indicated in this document.
